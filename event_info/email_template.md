## DataRescue at MIT 
https://datarescue-boston.github.io/mit 

Saturday, Feb 18th, 37-252, 8:30am-5pm

DataRescue at MIT is an opportunity for civic hackers, scientists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve at-risk federal data resources in the public interest, before they are suppressed from public view and use. The event is being organized by [MIT Association of Computational Science and Engineering Students](http://acses.mit.edu), [MIT Libraries](https://libraries.mit.edu), and [the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](http://envirodatagov.org), with support from [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://cee.mit.edu), [Environmental Solutions Initiative](https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/), and [MIT Graduate Student Council Initiatives Grant](http://gsc.mit.edu). 

Register for the event on Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/datarescue-boston-at-mit-tickets-31647096317

People with all levels of technical background are welcome. There will be a wide array of tasks including:
 - Browsing websites to identify data sets
 - Developing scripts and tools to scrape data
 - Processing and verifying data integrity
 - Uploading data to mirrors
 - Visualizing and documenting our efforts

We will also need volunteers to help run the event! In particular, we need people who have experience in scraping data, working with and ensuring the integrity of large data sets, and/or are comfortable leading groups.
