Feb 18th, 37-252, 8:30am-5pm

DataRescue at MIT is a hackathon focused on identifying, downloading, processing, and mirroring federal research data at risk of being taken down or obscured by the current administration. The event is being hosted by MIT ACSES, MIT Libraries, and EDGI. 

Register for the event on Eventbrite! https://www.eventbrite.com/e/datarescue-boston-at-mit-tickets-31647096317 

People with all levels of technical background are welcome. There will be a wide array of tasks including:
- Browsing websites to identify data sets
- Developing scripts and tools to scrape data
- Processing and verifying data integrity
- Uploading data to mirrors
- Visualizing and documenting our efforts

We will also need volunteers to help run the event! In particular, we need people who have experience in scraping data, working with and ensuring the integrity of large data sets, and/or are comfortable leading groups.
